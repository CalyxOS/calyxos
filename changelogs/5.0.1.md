* CalyxOS 5.0.1
* Android 14

### Known issues
* Certain banking apps / website crash. Will be fixed in the next build
* Google has changed how Work profile "Pausing" works. It's more like "Pause apps" now, where only notifications aren't shown, apps keep running. Will be changed to previous behavior.
* F-Droid will ask for unknown sources to install/update certain apps. Will be fixed in the next build.
* Lockscreen shortcuts are missing
* Custom status bar icons are missing
* Custom font selection is missing
* There might be certain other minor issues, but for the most part it should be solid.
