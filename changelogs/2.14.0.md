Pixel 2:
This is the final CalyxOS update for this device. Google stopped updating the Pixel 2 after Dec 2020.
Up till now, we provided extended support by patching the open source components: AOSP and the Linux kernel. Linux kernel 4.4 was a long-term support kernel, but has stopped receiving updates this month.
Unfortunately it is also not feasible to have Android 12 fully working on these devices. There are various community efforts, but there's no fully working port as far we know.
As such, we have decided to stop updating these devices. Apps such as Chromium and microG will still continue getting updates.

Mi A2:
This is the final CalyxOS Android 11 build for this device. We're currently working on getting Android 12 working, so far it looks quite promising. We'll keep posting updates on our website.
Do note that Xiaomi has stopped providing updates for this devices.
We've been keeping the open source components updated, and that's included in this build.
Additionally, the proprietary firmware componets are from September 2020,
since trying to upgrade to anything newer ends up factory resetting the device.
