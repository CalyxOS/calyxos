Pixel 2:
This is the final CalyxOS update for this device. Google stopped updating the Pixel 2 after Dec 2020.
We provided extended support by patching the open source components, however Linux 4.4 has
stopped receiving updates. It is also not feasible to have Android 12 fully working on this device.
As such, we have decided to stop updating this device. Apps such as Chromium and microG will still continue getting updates.

Mi A2:
This is the final CalyxOS Android 11 build for this device. We're currently working on getting
Android 12 working, so far it looks quite promising. We'll keep posting updates on our website.
Do note that Xiaomi has stopped providing updates for this devices.
We've been keeping the open source components updated, and that's included in this build.
Additionally, the proprietary firmware componets are from September 2020,
since trying to upgrade to anything newer ends up factory reseting the device.
