Pixel 2:
This is the final CalyxOS update for this device. Google had long stopped updating
this device, and unfortunately as things stand right now it is not feasible to have
Android 12 fully working on this device. As such, we have decided to stop updating this device.
Apps will still continue getting updates

Mi A2:
Xiaomi has stopped updating this device. This means that
they will not provide any more updates to the closed-source components,
such as the bootloader, modem firmware, and other firmware.
However, updates to the open source OS code and the Linux kernel
can still be merged by us, and are included in this build.
Additionally, the proprietary firmware componets are from September 2020,
since trying to upgrade to anything newer ends up factory reseting the device.
